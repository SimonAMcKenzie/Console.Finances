# Financial Analysis Project

This project involved analysing financial data using JavaScript to gain insights into how to use it for calculations. Here's what I did, why I did it, and how I accomplished the task:

## What I Did

I created a JavaScript script to analyse a dataset containing financial records. The dataset consisted of monthly financial data spanning several years. The goal was to calculate various metrics, such as the total number of months, total profits/losses, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in losses.

## Why I Did It

I undertook this task to practice my JavaScript skills and gain a better understanding of how to use it for data analysis. By working on this project, I aimed to strengthen my ability to manipulate arrays, perform calculations, and use conditional statements in JavaScript. Additionally, I wanted to improve my problem-solving skills, and this challange gave me the opportunity to tackle a real-world scenario involving financial data analysis.

## How I Did It

### Dataset
I started with the dates and corresponding figures provided, plus the html file needed for Google Console to output the data. 

### Calculations
1. **Total Months:** I calculated the total number of months in the dataset using the `length` property of JavaScript arrays.
2. **Total Profits/Losses:** I iterated through the dataset to calculate the total profits/losses by summing up the values.
3. **Average Change:** To find the average change, I calculated the total change in profits/losses and divided it by the total number of months minus one.
4. **Greatest Increase/Decrease:** I determined the greatest increase and decrease in profits/losses by comparing the differences between consecutive months.

### Displaying Results
I used `console.log()` statements to display the results of the analysis in the console. This allowed me to view the financial metrics directly in the browser's developer tools.
